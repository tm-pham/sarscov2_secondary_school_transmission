## Abstract

**Background:** The recent emergence of the Omicron variant has caused a new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections across many countries worldwide. We highlight which epidemiological parameters are crucial for understanding seasonal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and assessing interventions for effective infection control in secondary schools over a course of two and a half years. 

**Methods:** We developed an agent-based model that was parameterised using data from secondary schools in the Netherlands. We modelled the circulation of Omicron and accounted for uncertainty in epidemiological parameters that describe virus transmissibility, susceptibility to reinfection, vaccine immune escape, and waning of sterilizing immunity. We quantified the health burden on students defined as the number of symptomatic student days. We further evaluated the cost-benefit (number of prevented infected students per absent student) for reactive quarantine of classmates and close contacts, regular screening using antigen tests, and annual booster vaccination.  

**Findings:** Our results show that the duration of immunity waning is a key parameter that governs the medium-term transmission dynamics in secondary schools. Regular screening and annual booster campaigns may reduce the health burden by up to 15% (95% CI: 1.5%-27.8%) and are more cost-effective than reactive quarantine interventions. Due to waning of immunity, annual booster campaigns are mainly cost-effective mainly in winter periods. 

**Interpretation:** Regular screening and annual booster vaccination campaigns have the highest cost-benefit in reducing SARS-COV-2 transmission in schools in a medium-term future by reducing viral transmission with little disruption of the education of students.
