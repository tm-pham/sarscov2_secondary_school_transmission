## Abstract

**Background:** The Omicron variant has caused a new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide. We highlight which epidemiological parameters are crucial for understanding seasonal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and assess interventions for effective infection control in secondary schools over a course of two and a half years. 

**Methods:** We developed an agent-based model parameterised with data from secondary schools in the Netherlands. We modelled the circulation of Omicron and accounted for uncertainty in epidemiological parameters describing virus transmissibility, susceptibility to reinfection, vaccine immune escape, and waning of sterilising immunity. We quantified the health burden on students defined as the number of symptomatic student days. We further evaluated the cost-benefit (number of prevented infected students per absent student) for reactive quarantine interventions, regular screening using antigen tests, and annual booster vaccinations.  

**Findings:** The duration of immunity waning is a key parameter that governs the medium-term SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in secondary schools. We predict pronounced seasonal patterns with larger outbreaks in winter periods and a maximum of 2.9% (95% CI: 0.7%-6.6%) of students symptomatically infected annually.  Regular screening and annual booster campaigns may reduce the health burden by up to 15% (95% CI: 1.5%-27.8%) and have a higher cost-benefit than reactive quarantine interventions for which the reduction is only 4.3% (95% CI: -10.1% to 17.6%). 

**Interpretation:** Knowledge about immunity waning will be crucial for determining whether interventions are needed to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in secondary schools in the medium-term future. Screening and annual booster vaccinations have the highest cost-benefit by reducing viral transmission with little educational disruption.
